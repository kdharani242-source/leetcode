You are given a positive integer n. Each digit of n has a sign according to the following rules:

The most significant digit is assigned a positive sign.
Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.
Return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.


class Solution:
    def alternateDigitSum(self, n: int) -> int:
        x=str(n)
        y=0
        for i in range(len(x)):
            if(i%2==0):
                y+=int(x[i])
            else:
                y-=int(x[i])
        return y
